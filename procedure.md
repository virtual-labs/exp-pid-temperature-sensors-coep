## Procedure

#### 1. Piping Diagram Configuration

- Configure all parameters for the piping diagram. In which you need to identify vessels and equipment to run the plant.
- Click on the "Verify Components" button.
- If all configuration parameters are correct, the "Next Level" button will be visible.
- The button is placed below the "Verify Components" button.
- Click on the "Next Level" button to proceed.

#### 2. Instrument Diagram Configuration

- Follow the same steps as above to configure the instrument diagram, In this you will have identify the instruments required to run the plant.
- Click on the "Verify Instruments" button.
- If all configuration parameters are correct, the "Next Level" button will be visible.
- The button is placed below the "Verify Components" button.
- Click on the "Next Level" button to continue.

#### 3. Sequence of Activities

- Read the "Prior Knowledge Assessment" statements carefully.
- Enter the appropriate sequence number in the provided text box. The system will not allow you to write the duplicate numbers. Hence be careful
- Click on the "Submit" button.
- You have three attempts to verify whether the sequence is correct or otherwise.
- Try for three times and then proceed to the Simulation section.

#### 4. Simulation Execution

- Click on the "Start" button to observe the readings and simulation outputs. This step is important from understanding process point of view.
- The simulation will display the status and phases during execution.
- You can start the next test cycle or view the datasheet and trends according to the test cycles.
- The datasheet for each test cycle can be downloaded in PDF format by clicking on the "Download" button.
- Multiple readings are available in line format.
- Use the checkbox to view different series or hide specific series as needed.

#### 4.1. Data Monitoring & Graphs

- View the Datasheet and Trends according to the test cycles.
- The trend functionality allows you to see multiple readings in a line or trend format.
- Use the checkbox to switch between different series or hide/show specific data.
- Download the graph using the "Download Graph" button.

#### 4.2. Result Assessment

- Click on the "Result" button to view your performance assessment.
